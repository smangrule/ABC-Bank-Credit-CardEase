Product discovery is crucial in any project. This phase involves
understanding users\' needs and pain points, defining the core
functionalities, and ensuring that the product aligns with business

    > Gather feedback from stakeholders.

**7. Validate and Iterate**

-   **Stakeholder Review**: 
    > Present mockups and gather feedback from stakeholders to ensure alignment with business goals.

    > **Iteration**:

    > approved and ready for development.

Once we have a validated solution, we hand it over to the development
team and start for implementation of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
\[MVP, because I have selected Agile-Scrum Methodology for this case
study\]

**Key Deliverables**

-   Process Flow maps

    > Wireframes and Mockups

    > Feature prioritization and roadmap

    > MVP specification
